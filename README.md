A Programming Language Per Day

| Day | Language     | Notes                                                               |
|:---:|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | x86 Assembly | Uses a recursive backtracking algorithm capable of any number count |
| 2   | OCaml        | Uses no additional storage -- O(1) space -- but reads file twice    |
| 3   | Awk          | Single pass through file, counting all tree collisions              |
| 4   | Perl         | Regular expression all the things                                   |
| 5   | Bash         | Only uses bash + coreutils (tr and echo are the only external cmds) |
| 6   | Python       | Kakes use of generators and extensive list comprehensions           |
| 7   | Julia        | Regex + comprehension for input. Sets for determining composition   |
| 8   | Lua          | Translated from a javascript solution. My first lua program!        |
| 9   | F#           | (Ab)using sequences for fun(ctional programming) and profit         |
| 10  | Haskell      | Converted my OCaml solution to Haskell                              |
| 11  | C            | Total of two dynamic memory allocations -- size is not hardcoded.   |
| 12  | Swift        | Combination of Functional, Object-oriented, and fun with enums      |
| 13  |              |                                                                     |
| 14  | Ruby         | Standard object-oriented Ruby                                       |
| 15  | PHP          | Uses a closure to simplify implementation                           |
| 16  |              |                                                                     |
| 17  | C++20        |                                                                     |
| 18  | Flex + Bison | Building your own compiler counts as a language, right?             |
| 19  | Kotlin       |                                                                     |
